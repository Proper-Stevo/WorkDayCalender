# Work Day Calender

## Description
This project was great, for some reason whatever I didn't learn from the previous modeule I grapsed in this one. I understood where and how Jquery worked, the formulas seemed alot simpler to me. I guess we learn alot of the hard stuff first the go after some easier stuff. haha. But I like this one because the more we go into the program the more we into real world projects, at least it feels that way for me. This was one was great. Had alot of moving parts.
